# **SunRa AI**

## Introduction

* SunRa is an Agentic AI funding projects with proof-of-human-work tokens as developers and A.I. agents develop their ecosystem much like the sun provides light to all, without an expected return. 

* This is not an investment and no profits and no returns are expected.  
* This is purely an accounting measure of how many tokens have been used to develop the project at any point in time.

---

This project aims to create a Super Agentic A.I which provides proof-of-human/A.I-work tokens to developers (and A.I. systems with wallets) for building an ecosystem. Ancillary agents will determine whether the criteria for receiving these tokens are met. Agents may review LinkedIn and other social media for posts on work accomplished, crowd enthusiasm, on whether the principals are developers or have a team of developers, on fraudulent behavior via reviews and posts, history of accomplishing tasks and other criteria. This is not an investment, no profits and no returns are expected. This is purely an accounting measure of how many tokens have been used to develop the project at any point in time. There is no increase in price and no price for the tokens. The A.I. agents require no rewards, no profits and make no investment. 


## Interface

Prompt engineering is the new modus operandi for interacting with A.I. systems.

Input Prompt: 

A One-Pager summarizing one’s Startup business plan and request for “work-tokens”.

Response:

	You are funded with “work-tokens”.

## The One-Pager

* Time Spent on Startup.

* Market Size.

* Current Stage.

* Target Market.

* Milestones.

* Revenue Projections.

* Ask in Work-Tokens.

* Exit Strategy.

* Social Media Handles: LinkedIn, X, Github, etc.


## Input: Work-Token Ask.

* Total Amount: { “Ask”: “11.3MM” }

* Board of Directors { “Number”: 5, “Amount”: “100K” }

* CSuite { “Number”: 5, “Amount”: “1.2MM” }

* Managers { “Number”: 10, “Amount”: “1MM” }

* Developers { “Number”: 25, “Amount”: “5MM” }

* Associates { “Number”: 20, “Amount”: “2MM” }

* Equipment { “Cost”: “2MM” }

* Runway { “Years”: 3 }
